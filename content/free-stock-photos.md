Quality photos and images can instantly make a website look better and feel more professional. Using random images from the internet can be a bad idea and lead to copyright issues. There are a bunch of great resources these days for free stock photography, all of which can be used with zero copyright restrictions. Here are some of my favorites:

Great stock photos from Shopify for just about anything. In true Shopify fashion, they have a "business ideas" section to help with specific products for an online store.

Beautiful, high quality stock photos for just about any use you can think of. There isn't as large of a selection as the choices above, but you can still find something useful most of the time.

High-quality photographs that have been taken by a photographer from their community. Their site has some ads but is pretty useful for stock photos.
